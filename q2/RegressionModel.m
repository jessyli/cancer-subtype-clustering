function [loss] = RegressionModel(data,labels,mode)
% Implements a regression model
% Inputs: data - a 1000 by 25 matrix containing the data from 1000 patients.
%         labels - a 1 by 1000 vector containting the survival times for the patients
%         mode - a flag that determines which batch selection strategy is used. 1 = default selection mode; 2 = diverse label mode
% Outputs: loss a 1 by 90 vector that returns the generalization error as function of the number of rounds (90) 

loss = zeros(1,90);
